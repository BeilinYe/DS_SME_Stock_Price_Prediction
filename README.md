# Project 2: AI-Powered SME Stock Prediction with LSTM, ESN, and Tree-Based Approaches
**Teamwork Project**

## Project Motivation  
- Addresses the lack of effective tools for investors in small to medium-sized U.S. companies.
- Leverages AI and machine learning to provide reliable stock market projections.

## Project Accomplishments and Results  
- Conducted market needs assessment to identify user needs and translate them into engineering requirements.
- Identified market needs for supporting investor decision-making.
- Successfully identified and evaluated five candidate models (LSTM, ESN, and tree-based approaches) for SME stock price prediction, with Echo State Networks (ESN) emerging as the most effective solution. The ESN achieved an RMSE of 12.79 for 1-day predictions and maintained excellent efficiency, demonstrating superior performance compared to other models despite a decrease in accuracy for 10-day predictions.

## Technical Skills  
- Python, Pandas, NumPy  
- Machine Learning models: LSTM, Echo State Networks, Tree-Based Models  
- User-centered design process
